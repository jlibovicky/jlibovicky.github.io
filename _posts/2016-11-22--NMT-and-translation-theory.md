title: Neural Machine Translation and Translation Theory
---

A year ago at [EMNLP in Lisbon](http://www.emnlp2015.org/) I saw a paper call
[On Statistical Machine Translation and Translation
Theory](http://www.emnlp2015.org/proceedings/DiscoMT/pdf/DiscoMT22.pdf) by
Christian Hardmeier. He was standing in a brown jacket in front of his poster
and almost apologized to everybody who stood by his poster that the poster
does not present any improvements in statistical machine translation - just
reflects how it works with respect to the translation theory. Sadly, this
interesting paper was published at the moment when the statistical translation
started to be replaced by neural models.

In this post, we will have a look at whether and how did the issues from the
paper changed by introducing the entirely new class of models.

## Difference between statistical and neural translation

## Cultural twist
