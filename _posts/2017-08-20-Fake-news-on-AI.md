title: Fake news on AI

__[Česká verze příspěvku](/2017/05/29/Fake-news-o-AI.html)__

While reading news stories about research or products involving deep learning, I
get often astonished how inaccurate and misleading the news stories are.
(Admittedly, the same feeling must have doctors, flight engineers and other
experts reading articles on their filed)

News stories are competing the get our attention in a world where so many things
to do. There the news stories that appear in the news must satisfy some criteria
to even get chance to attract the readers attention, these are often call [news
values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_values).

It is obvious, the news must be simplified and put in a shape that fits the news
values. This why the media tend to avoid complicated technical terminology with
something more familiar to the readers -- in this case the terminology often
comes from science fiction re-narrating the myth about the mankind getting into
trouble by not reflecting the potential of recent technology.

# Neural Network Simulates Brain

One of the evergreen of popular articles mentioning deep learning is comparison
to human or animal brains.

The way media talk about AI techonolgies (even the usage of the term AI)
intentionally resembles the way AI is depicted in the sci-fi literature and
movies. Illustration photos in the news stories usually come from the movies.

_TODO: some examples_

This might be what makes the stories more attractive to the users, but it is
highly missleading while talking about the potential risks of AI because the
sci-fi conceptualization tend to make us think about sci-fi risks. What comes to
our minds are technologz getting out of control eventually exterminating
humanity.

The main risks are different. What I would worry the most is criminal abuse. I
can imagine robots crawling web and finding oportunities for blackmailing
people (matching faces from LinkedIn images with some or wild parties photos).
