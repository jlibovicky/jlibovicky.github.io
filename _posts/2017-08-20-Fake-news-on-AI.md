__[Česká verze příspěvku](/2017/05/29/Fake-news-o-AI.html)__

While reading news stories about research or products involving deep learning, I
get often astonished how inaccurate and misleading the news stories are.
(Admittedly, the same feeling must have doctors, flight engineers and other
experts reading articles on their filed)

News stories are competing the get our attention in a world where so many things
to do. There the news stories that appear in the news must satisfy some criteria
to even get chance to attract the readers attention, these are often call [news
values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_values).

It is obvious, the news must be simplified and put in a shape that fits the news
values. This why the media tend to avoid complicated technical terminology with
something more familiar to the readers -- in this case the terminology often
comes from science fiction re-narrating the myth about the mankind getting into
trouble by not reflecting the potential of recent technology.

One of the evergreen of popular articles mentioning deep learning is comparison
to human or animal brains.
