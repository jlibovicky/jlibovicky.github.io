Since I was a little I was astonished how weird sport biathlon is. I couldn't
imagine How could someone possible invent a combination of cross-country skying
and shooting. I blew my mind when I found out there is even weirder combination
of disciplines called modern pentathlon. With this preparation, it was no
surprise that there exist annual competitions in machine translation and many
other tasks.

# The AI combats

There are many computer science competitions in fields that could be called
artificial intelligence and more and more appear every year. The reason is
simple - more and more computer scientists (and scientists in general) in the
world demand to satisfy their urge to compete with each other. Not every
competition looks like when [Deep
Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov) or
[AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol) try to beat
the champions of the most difficult board games, which typically ends with
exaltation and jubilation of the engineers in front of journalists' cameras in
room conspicuously similar to NASA mission control center.

The competitions are less spectacular and dramatic. While announcing a
competition, organizer provide the competing teams with the training data
(system inputs and expected outputs), which they can train the system on, and
some test data and evaluation methodology (software) they can used for an
independent test of the system performance.  The data that will be used for the
final evaluation are kept in secret, so that the teams cannot cheat by
tailoring the system to the test data.

In case of the already mentioned machine translation, the training data are
publicly available so called parallel corpora - files of millions or even
billions sentence pairs which are translations of each other. They are either
crawled automatically from the web or they can be proceedings of various
European or international institutions. The test data are newspaper stories
collected and translated for the particular year of the competition.

Machine translation is not the only task computer scientists compete in. Some
of them are very specialized tasks, hardly comprehensible of an non-expert. On
the other hand, there some very practical tasks and some them were able to
achieve quite a lot media attention. In 2009, video streaming service provider
Netflix held [a competition in predicting user rating for
movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize), based on other the user's
history and preferences of other users. Quite popular are also competition in
[robotic football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCup) or [DARPA Grand
Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge), a competition
of autonomous car. By the way, in the first round, in 2004, all of the cares
get lost none of the competing cars was able to manage 240 km in Mohave desert.
Today's car are able to orient in urban traffic.
